---
## Purpose
This repo helps a RAPIDS user quickly and easily 
1. Install RAPIDS into a SageMaker Studio Lab instance
1. Get to notebooks and other repos that they can run and explore RAPIDS
1. Provide tips and tricks to help them have a great experience trying out RAPIDS on SageMaker

## Install RAPIDS on SageMaker Studio Lab
Our in depth install guide is [here, if you want to preview it](rapids-smsl.ipynb): 

To run this guide, you only need two things:
1. An active SageMaker Studio Lab account (get one here: https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)
1. An actively running GPU instance in that account

When you have that ready, if you want to just install RAPIDS into SageMaker Studio Lab, the easiest way is:
1. Click this button right here --> [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://rapids.ai/smsl.html)
2. Click the `Copy to Project` button
3. When prompted, select `Clone Entire Repo`
4. After customizing any directories, ensure that `Search for environment.yml and build Conda environment` is checked and click `Clone`
5. Once completed, please go to **[Links to RAPIDS Notebooks and Repos](rapids-smsl.ipynb#Links-to-RAPIDS-Notebooks-and-Repos)** and pull in some notebooks to run RAPIDS on!

### Known Issues
1. `Libnuma` dependancy causes cuML and cugraph to fail import in RAPIDS 22.02 and possible 22.04
  1. cuML user workaround: Uninstall ucx-py using conda in your RAPIDS 
  2. cuGraph user workaround: Install RAPIDS 21.12 if you require cuGraph.  cuGraph will not work for RAPIDS versions 22.02 and possible 22.04  A fix will be introduced in 22.06.
